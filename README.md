# Quadratic-Function-Calculator
Learning C++

 This is my first code using C++.

 I used my first knowledge of the language to create a Quadratic Function Calculator.

 You enter the values ​​of a, b and c, then the Delta value will be calculated and finally you will define how many real roots the function has and what they are.

This is my second code with C++ and my first code without help. It's simple, but I'm growing.
